# Machine-Learning-Based-Malware-Classification-based-on-API-call-Histogram


With the increase in the variety of malware samples, malware classification has become important. Static,
dynamic, and hybrid features are extracted to classify the different malware samples into different malware
families. In this work, we focus on classifying malware samples into 9 classes. The task aims to classify API
call histogram input values into different malware classes. API call frequencies are the static representation of
the behaviour of malware classes. The dataset was gathered from the International CyberSecurity Data Mining
Competition (CDMC) 2022, provided by Paul Black. The primary approach to the problem consists of
exploratory data analysis, training different machine learning models (Support Vector Machine, Multi-layer
Perceptron, CatBoost, Random Forest) and comparing their training with a baseline model (Decision Tree). To
evaluate the performance of the models on the test data (unlabelled), we use Cohenâ€™s Kappa score. The score for
our models shows the reliability of the models.
